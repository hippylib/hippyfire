This study presents the implementation of \texttt{hIPPYfire}, a solver for large-scale Bayesian and deterministic inverse problems based on partial differential equations (PDEs). It is based on the same scalable algorithms as its predecessor, \texttt{hIPPYlib}, and computes the solution of the inverse problem at a cost independent of the parameter dimension. However, unlike \texttt{hIPPYlib} (which is built on FEniCS), \texttt{hIPPYfire} uses Firedrake to solve the PDE governing the forward problem. Firedrake presents a unique modular structure that clearly distinguishes between the programming and mathematical aspects of the library---thereby enabling contributions from programmers and mathematicians alike and ensuring its consistent development. The solver is validated by running it on a Bayesian inversion case and computing the solution of the forward problem and the MAP point by using an inexact Newton-CG method. The promising results obtained in this study, coupled with the efficient abstraction in Firedrake, provide a lot of motivation for incorporating additional functionality into \texttt{hIPPYfire}.
