%%%%%%%%%%%%%FIREDRAKE VS FENICS

Similar to The FEniCS Project's DOLFIN library \cite{alnaes2015fenics, logg2010dolfin}, Firedrake \cite{rathgeber2016firedrake} is a library that provides automated solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) using the finite element method (FEM). The philosophy behind the development of these frameworks was separation of concerns. Since a multidisciplinary skillset, which ranges from mathematical expertise in numerical analyses to a deep understanding of parallel computation, is required for the development of these tools, it became more practical to develop abstract layers in the library that catered to a particular skillset.
